# General info

When you open ServicePlatform website, firstly customer page will welcome you. When you click the add button to add customer information on this page, a form appears as a sidebar in the right corner of the page. When you fill it in, you create a new customer.
You can show or hide the form every time you click because of that it has a toggle feature.<br/>
Other features are that you can filter by customer name or delete the customer. <br/>
Finally, when you click the update button, you will go to the page with that person's information card. In this page, you can not only see customer's info but also can edit its info. (I got error in this edip part, I am trying to solve)
